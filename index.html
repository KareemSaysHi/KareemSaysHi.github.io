"Hello World" 
<table><tr><td><img src="http://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/GTM/warner.jpg" width=90 height=140 alt=""></td><td><p>If I were a Springer-Verlag Graduate Text in Mathematics, I would be Frank Warner's <b><i>Foundations of Differentiable Manifolds and Lie Groups</i></b>.</p><p> I give a clear, detailed, and careful development of the basic facts on manifold theory and Lie Groups. I include differentiable manifolds, tensors and differentiable forms. Lie groups and homogenous spaces, integration on manifolds, and in addition provide a proof of the de Rham theorem via sheaf cohomology theory, and develop the local theory of elliptic operators culminating in a proof of the Hodge theorem.  Those interested in any of the diverse areas of mathematics requiring the notion of a differentiable manifold will find me extremely useful.  </p> <p>Which Springer GTM would <i>you</i> be?  <a href="http://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/GTM.html">The Springer GTM Test</a></p></td></tr></table>
